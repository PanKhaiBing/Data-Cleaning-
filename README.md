Hi, 

This project is to perform data cleaning on dirty data and transforming it into useful datasets for further analysis.

Process of data cleaning included:
1. Removing duplicate rows
2. Combining columns 
3. Rename columns and removing symbols for calculation purpose
4. Replace NaN to 0 for 'discount' and 'qty_sold'
5. Changing the data type for calculation purpose

Dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle.
